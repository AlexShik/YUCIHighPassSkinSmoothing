##Performance

Tests are made in Instruments with the "OpenGL ES Analysis" template. 

The `CIContext` object is created with `EAGLContext` and a sRGB working color space (`CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB()`).

Image Size: 640 x 800
Input Radius: 7.0
Operation System: iOS 9

Device: iPhone 5s / FPS: 60
Device: iPhone 5  / FPS: ~24
```

##Concepts

The basic routine of `YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothingFilter` can be described with the following diagram.

You may want to google [High Pass Skin Smoothing](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=photoshop+high+pass+skin+smoothing) and do the steps in Photoshop or any other image editing software you prefer first before trying to understand the diagram below.

####The High Pass Filter

There's no `High Pass` filter in CoreImage. Luckily it's not hard to create one (`Photoshop: High Pass` section in the diagram):

> A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not have one, can be done by duplicating the layer, putting a gaussian blur, inverting, and then blending with the original layer using an opacity (say 50%) with the original layer.

####Input Parameters



##Consideration

For the best effect, you need to create the `CIContext` object with a sRGB working color space instead of the default light-linear color space. You can specify a working color space when creating a context using the `kCIContextWorkingColorSpace` key in the `options` dictionary.

##Usage

Just use the `YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothingFilter` class.

##Installation

Either clone the repo and manually add the files in `Sources` directory

or if you use Cocoapods, add the following to your Podfile

	pod 'YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing'
